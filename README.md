I'm a third year CS & Chemistry student at UMass Amherst with interests in the applications of data science and machine learning to bioinformatics and public health. I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner and am passionate about using my skills to make an impact in healthcare.

## Featured Project
Currently, I'm working on a content-based retrieval image project supervised by Novartis in collaboration with the Break Through Tech AI evaluating the performance of different models' ability to return similar images from a histopathological image database given a query image. 
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Albumentations, FAISS, Jupyter
- **What we did:** Our team evaluated the ability of the PLIP, UNI, and Flava to return similar images given a list of image matches provided by a pathologist
