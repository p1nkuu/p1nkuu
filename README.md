I'm a third year CS & Chemistry student at UMass Amherst. My interests lie primarily in the applications of data science and machine learning to bioinformatics and public health. I like to think of myself as a lifelong learner and am passionate about using my skills to make an impact in healthcare.

Ask me about: 
- 🧬 my statistical genetics research at Boston University 
- 💻 my computer vision work in content-based retrieval for images under Novartis
- 🍵 my favorite cafes to get matcha at!

## 📸 Featured Project
Currently, I'm working on a content-based retrieval image project supervised by Novartis in collaboration with the Break Through Tech AI evaluating the performance of different models' ability to return similar images from a histopathological image database given a query image. 
- **Tools:** Python, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Albumentations, FAISS, Jupyter 
- **What we did:** Our team evaluated the ability of the PLIP, UNI, and Flava to return similar images given a list of image matches provided by a pathologist 

## 🛠 Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python, Java, R, SAS, TypeScript, JavaScript, C \
**Libraries:** Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib \
